# Gamereviewapp

As a passionate about video games, I like to know the ratings of these to make the best decisions when buying one and what better way to see those ratings on a website that shows the ratings of 350,000+ video games as well as details of them such as release date, description, Metacritic score, platforms, among others. This website also has a section of movies and login that I'm looking to include in the future.
